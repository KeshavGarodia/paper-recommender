A Survey on Graph Classification and Link Prediction based on GNN,"Traditional convolutional neural networks are limited to handling Euclidean space data, overlooking the vast realm of real-life scenarios represented as graph data, including transportation networks, social networks, and reference networks. The pivotal step in transferring convolutional neural networks to graph data analysis and processing lies in the construction of graph convolutional operators and graph pooling operators. This comprehensive review article delves into the world of graph convolutional neural networks. Firstly, it elaborates on the fundamentals of graph convolutional neural networks. Subsequently, it elucidates the graph neural network models based on attention mechanisms and autoencoders, summarizing their application in node classification, graph classification, and link prediction along with the associated datasets.","Xingyu Liu, Juan Chen, Quan Wen",2023-07-03T09:08:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00865v1
Graph Structure of Neural Networks,"Neural networks are often represented as graphs of connections between neurons. However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a ""sweet spot"" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.","Jiaxuan You, Jure Leskovec, Kaiming He, Saining Xie",2020-07-13T17:59:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06559v2
Sampling and Recovery of Graph Signals based on Graph Neural Networks,"We propose interpretable graph neural networks for sampling and recovery of graph signals, respectively. To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification. The results show that our method consistently improves the classification accuracies.","Siheng Chen, Maosen Li, Ya Zhang",2020-11-03T01:45:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01412v1
Graph Neural Networks for Small Graph and Giant Network Representation   Learning: An Overview,"Graph neural networks denote a group of neural network models introduced for the representation learning tasks on graph data specifically. Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph neural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small graphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks instead. The readers are also suggested to refer to these papers for detailed information when reading this tutorial paper.",Jiawei Zhang,2019-08-01T02:35:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00187v1
Graph Neural Processes: Towards Bayesian Graph Neural Networks,"We introduce Graph Neural Processes (GNP), inspired by the recent work in conditional and latent neural processes. A Graph Neural Process is defined as a Conditional Neural Process that operates on arbitrary graph data. It takes features of sparsely observed context points as input, and outputs a distribution over target points. We demonstrate graph neural processes in edge imputation and discuss benefits and drawbacks of the method for other application areas. One major benefit of GNPs is the ability to quantify uncertainty in deep learning on graph structures. An additional benefit of this method is the ability to extend graph neural networks to inputs of dynamic sized graphs.","Andrew Carr, David Wingate",2019-02-26T16:39:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10042v2
Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Graph Completion,"Graph data is omnipresent and has a wide variety of applications, such as in natural science, social networks, or the semantic web. However, while being rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node classification.","Luisa Werner, Nabil Layaïda, Pierre Genevès, Sarah Chlyah",2023-03-27T07:53:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15487v3

deepstruct -- linking deep learning and graph theory,"deepstruct connects deep learning models and graph theory such that different graph structures can be imposed on neural networks or graph structures can be extracted from trained neural network models. For this, deepstruct provides deep neural network models with different restrictions which can be created based on an initial graph. Further, tools to extract graph structures from trained models are available. This step of extracting graphs can be computationally expensive even for models of just a few dozen thousand parameters and poses a challenging problem. deepstruct supports research in pruning, neural architecture search, automated network design and structure analysis of neural networks.","Julian Stier, Michael Granitzer",2021-11-12T11:58:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06679v2
Graph Wavelet Neural Network,"We present graph wavelet neural network (GWNN), a novel graph convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging graph wavelet transform to address the shortcomings of previous spectral graph CNN methods that depend on graph Fourier transform. Different from graph Fourier transform, graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high efficiency and good interpretability for graph convolution. The proposed GWNN significantly outperforms previous spectral graph CNNs in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification on three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.","Bingbing Xu, Huawei Shen, Qi Cao, Yunqi Qiu, Xueqi Cheng",2019-04-12T08:20:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07785v1
Quantum Graph Neural Networks,"We introduce Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN), a new class of quantum neural network ansatze which are tailored to represent quantum processes which have a graph structure, and are particularly suitable to be executed on distributed quantum systems over a quantum network. Along with this general class of ansatze, we introduce further specialized architectures, namely, Quantum Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNN) and Quantum Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (QGCNN). We provide four example applications of QGNNs: learning Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum systems, learning how to create multipartite entanglement in a quantum network, unsupervised learning for spectral clustering, and supervised learning for graph isomorphism classification.","Guillaume Verdon, Trevor McCourt, Enxhell Luzhnica, Vikash Singh, Stefan Leichenauer, Jack Hidary",2019-09-26T17:19:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12264v1
An Energy-Based View of Graph Neural Networks,"Graph neural networks are a popular variant of neural networks that work with graph-structured data. In this work, we consider combining graph neural networks with the energy-based view of Grathwohl et al. (2019) with the aim of obtaining a more robust classifier. We successfully implement this framework by proposing a novel method to ensure generation over features as well as the adjacency matrix and evaluate our method against the standard graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture (Kipf & Welling (2016)). Our approach obtains comparable discriminative performance while improving robustness, opening promising new directions for future research for energy-based graph neural networks.","John Y.

A Graph Neural Network with Negative Message Passing for Graph Coloring,"Graph neural networks have received increased attention over the past years due to their promising ability to handle graph-structured data, which can be found in many real-world problems such as recommended systems and drug synthesis. Most existing research focuses on using graph neural networks to solve homophilous problems, but little attention has been paid to heterophily-type problems. In this paper, we propose a graph network model for graph coloring, which is a class of representative heterophilous problems. Different from the conventional graph networks, we introduce negative message passing into the proposed graph neural network for more effective information exchange in handling graph coloring problems. Moreover, a new loss function taking into account the self-information of the nodes is suggested to accelerate the learning process. Experimental studies are carried out to compare the proposed graph model with five state-of-the-art algorithms on ten publicly available graph coloring problems and one real-world application. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph neural network.","Xiangyu Wang, Xueming Yan, Yaochu Jin",2023-01-26T15:08:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11164v1
Get Rid of Suspended Animation Problem: Deep Diffusive Neural Network on   Graph Semi-Supervised Classification,"Existing graph neural networks may suffer from the ""suspended animation problem"" when the model architecture goes deep. Meanwhile, for some graph learning scenarios, e.g., nodes with text/image attributes or graphs with long-distance node correlations, deep graph neural networks will be necessary for effective graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new graph neural network, namely DIFNET (Graph Diffusive Neural Network), for graph representation learning and node classification. DIFNET utilizes both neural gates and graph residual learning for node hidden state modeling, and includes an attention mechanism for node neighborhood information diffusion. Extensive experiments will be done in this paper to compare DIFNET against several state-of-the-art graph neural network models. The experimental results can illustrate both the learning performance advantages and effectiveness of DIFNET, especially in addressing the ""suspended animation problem"".",Jiawei Zhang,2020-01-22T09:19:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07922v1
Graph Unrolling Networks: Interpretable Neural Networks for Graph Signal   Denoising,"We propose an interpretable graph neural network framework to denoise single or multiple noisy graph signals. The proposed graph unrolling networks expand algorithm unrolling to the graph domain and provide an interpretation of the architecture design from a signal processing perspective. We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two special cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC) and graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional denoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks. For denoising a single smooth graph signal, the normalized mean square error of the proposed networks is around 40% and 60% lower than that of graph Laplacian denoising and graph wavelets, respectively.","Siheng Chen, Yonina C.

This paper proposed novel Capsule Graph Neural Networks that use the EM routing mechanism (CapsGNNEM) to generate high-quality graph embeddings. Experimental results on a number of real-world graph datasets demonstrate that the proposed CapsGNNEM outperforms nine state-of-the-art models in graph classification tasks.","Yu Lei, Jing Zhang",2021-10-18T06:23:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09039v1
Sheaf Neural Networks,"We present a generalization of graph convolutional networks by generalizing the diffusion operation underlying this class of graph neural networks. These sheaf neural networks are based on the sheaf Laplacian, a generalization of the graph Laplacian that encodes additional relational structure parameterized by the underlying graph. The sheaf Laplacian and associated matrices provide an extended version of the diffusion operation in graph convolutional networks, providing a proper generalization for domains where relations between nodes are non-constant, asymmetric, and varying in dimension. We show that the resulting sheaf neural networks can outperform graph convolutional networks in domains where relations between nodes are asymmetric and signed.","Jakob Hansen, Thomas Gebhart",2020-12-08T01:19:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06333v1

"Graph Neural Networks: Taxonomy, Advances and Trends","Graph neural networks provide a powerful toolkit for embedding real-world graphs into low-dimensional spaces according to specific tasks. Up to now, there have been several surveys on this topic. However, they usually lay emphasis on different angles so that the readers can not see a panorama of the graph neural networks. This survey aims to overcome this limitation, and provide a comprehensive review on the graph neural networks. First of all, we provide a novel taxonomy for the graph neural networks, and then refer to up to 400 relevant literatures to show the panorama of the graph neural networks. All of them are classified into the corresponding categories. In order to drive the graph neural networks into a new stage, we summarize four future research directions so as to overcome the facing challenges. It is expected that more and more scholars can understand and exploit the graph neural networks, and use them in their research community.","Yu Zhou, Haixia Zheng, Xin Huang, Shufeng Hao, Dengao Li, Jumin Zhao",2020-12-16T05:50:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08752v4
Exploiting Edge Features in Graph Neural Networks,"Edge features contain important information about graphs. However, current state-of-the-art neural network models designed for graph learning, e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT), adequately utilize edge features, especially multi-dimensional edge features. In this paper, we build a new framework for a family of new graph neural network models that can more sufficiently exploit edge features, including those of undirected or multi-dimensional edges. The proposed framework can consolidate current graph neural network models; e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT). The proposed framework and new models have the following novelties: First, we propose to use doubly stochastic normalization of graph edge features instead of the commonly used row or symmetric normalization approches used in current graph neural networks. Second, we construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new framework, edge features are adaptive across network layers. As a result, our proposed new framework and new models can exploit a rich source of graph information. We apply our new models to graph node classification on several citation networks, whole graph classification, and regression on several molecular datasets. Compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e. GCNs and GAT, our models obtain better performance, which testify to the importance of exploiting edge features in graph neural networks.","Liyu Gong, Qiang Cheng",2018-09-07T23:18:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02709v2
Hierarchical Bipartite Graph Convolution Networks,"Recently, graph neural networks have been adopted in a wide variety of applications ranging from relational representations to modeling irregular data domains such as point clouds and social graphs. However, the space of graph neural network architectures remains highly fragmented impeding the development of optimized implementations similar to what is available for convolutional neural networks. In this work, we present BiGraphNet, a graph neural network architecture that generalizes many popular graph neural network models and enables new efficient operations similar to those supported by ConvNets. By explicitly separating the input and output nodes, BiGraphNet: (i) generalizes the graph convolution to support new efficient operations such as coarsened graph convolutions (similar to strided convolution in convnets), multiple input graphs convolution and graph expansions (unpooling) which can be used to implement various graph architectures such as graph autoencoders, and graph residual nets; and (ii) accelerates and scales the computations and memory requirements in hierarchical networks by performing computations only at specified output nodes.",Marcel Nassar,2018-11-17T02:43:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03813v2
